# ðŸ“ŠExcel-vs-Power-BI-Comparison-Project

  
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I analyzed the same dataset (Sleep, Health & Lifestyle) in both Excel and Power BI to compare efficiency, interactivity, and insights between the tools.


## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- Excel (PivotTables, slicers, formatting)  
- Power BI (Power Query, DAX, slicers)  
- Theming & visualization consistency  
- Comparative data storytelling  


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Attributes: Sleep hours, stress levels, physical activity, health conditions.  


## ðŸ”‘ Process
- Cleaned dataset (handled blanks, grouped ages & activity levels).  
- Built Excel dashboard using PivotTables & slicers.  
- Built Power BI dashboard with DAX measures & interactive visuals.  
- Applied consistent theme (Accessible Orchid) across both tools.  


## ðŸ“Š Comparison
- **Data Cleaning:** Excel required manual steps; Power BI was smoother.  
- **KPIs:** Excel relied on PivotTables; Power BI used reusable DAX.  
- **Visuals:** Excel needed more formatting; Power BI was quicker & dynamic.  
- **Interactivity:** Excel slicers connected manually; Power BI updated all visuals instantly.  
- **Efficiency:** Power BI was faster overall once model was built.  


## âœ¨ Takeaway
Excel builds the foundation, but Power BI elevates dashboards into dynamic, professional tools. Using both expanded my analytical thinking and storytelling ability.
